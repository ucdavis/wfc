<br>
Strategic Plan 2019-2024
<br>
Our Mission
<br>
The World Food Center mobilizes the resources of UC Davis to promote innovative, sustainable and
<br>
equitable food systems.
<br>
<br>
Our Vision
<br>
UC Davis is recognized as the global hub for innovative solutions to meet the challenge of providing safe,
<br>
nutritious and affordable food for all.
<br>
<br>
Our Plan
<br>
Ranked first in the nation in agriculture and veterinary science, the breadth, depth and quality of UC Davis’
<br>
faculty, research and educational programs in food systems and its many related areas is extraordinary.
<br>
<br>
UC Davis is recognized as a world leader in addressing the grand challenges facing global food systems.
<br>
<br>
UC Davis’ strategic plan, To Boldly Go, expressly endorses the World Food Center as the key to connecting
<br>
the university’s clusters of research excellence with industry, consumers, and public and philanthropic
<br>
entities to promote innovative, sustainable and equitable food systems. Similarly, the strategic plan of the
<br>
College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences lists advancing sustainable agriculture and food systems
<br>
as one of its four priority themes.
<br>
<br>
The World Food Center has developed an ambitious five-year plan with three strategic priorities to fulfill its
<br>
vision of extending UC Davis’ global leadership in food systems solutions:
<br>
The World Food Center will CONVENE UC Davis stakeholders working in food systems to
<br>
advance interdisciplinary collaboration.
<br>
<br>
UC Davis is home to over 60 centers and institutes and more than 400 faculty working across the university
<br>
in food systems. The World Food Center will bring these researchers together to synergize interdisciplinary
<br>
research and extension teams and magnify their effectiveness.
<br>
<br>
The World Food Center will CONNECT UC Davis experts in global food systems to external
<br>
partners to facilitate research opportunities and foster partnerships.
<br>
<br>
The World Food Center will actively develop relationships with industry, government, academic, and
<br>
public/private organizations to promote UC Davis’ expertise in food systems and build mutually beneficial
<br>
partnerships for research, outreach, and education.
<br>
<br>
The World Food Center will COMMUNICATE the innovations and accomplishments of
<br>
UC Davis centers, institutes, and scholars to amplify their contributions to improving global
<br>
food systems.
<br>
<br>
The World Food Center will promote UC Davis as the preeminent authority and resource for cutting-edge
<br>
innovations and solutions to grand challenges in food systems.
