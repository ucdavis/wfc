VI. The Strategic Planning Process
<br>
To Boldly Go embraces the World Food Center as an important vehicle for implementing
<br>
university-wide goals of tapping into the depth of food and agriculture scholarship and
<br>
extension, developing partnerships in research and innovation, and raising the visibility of the
<br>
university’s expertise and resources in food systems.
<br>
<br>
Upon the World Food Center’s transition to the College of Agricultural and Environmental
<br>
Sciences, a new framework for activities was developed by a faculty visioning committee and
<br>
launched in 2017 under the leadership of an interim director. This strategy was implemented
<br>
by refocusing the mission of the World Food Center and establishing a series of successful pilot
<br>
programs to foster university-wide interdisciplinary engagement.
<br>
<br>
Development of this strategic plan started in February 2018 by interviewing UC Davis faculty
<br>
members and regional industry and community leaders to discuss how the World Food Center
<br>
could support their goals. In January 2019, the College of Agricultural and Environmental
<br>
Sciences appointed an Associate Dean of Global Engagement to direct the World Food Center
<br>
and the College’s international programs. The Associate Dean, in collaboration with the
<br>
Steering Committee for the 2019 strategic planning process, has worked diligently to translate
<br>
these recommendations into an ambitious program with three main goals to be accomplished
<br>
with concrete, measurable steps.
