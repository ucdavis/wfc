A5 Consortium
<br>
The World Food Center serves as the UC Davis partner in
<br>
the A5 Consortium, a joint effort of the top five agricultural
<br>
universities in the World: UC Davis, Wageningen University,
<br>
Cornell, China Agricultural University and University of
<br>
Sao Paulo. Initiated in 2018, this consortium focuses on
<br>
educational exchanges and research collaborations in a
<br>
united effort to tackle the UN Sustainable Development
<br>
goals, with particular emphasis on goal #2, “Zero Hunger.”
<br>
Representatives of the Consortium met several times in
<br>
2019 to develop student exchanges that will take place
<br>
in 2020.
