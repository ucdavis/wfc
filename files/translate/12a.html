Strategic Priorities
<br>
Strategic Priority I:
<br>
The World Food Center will CONVENE UC Davis stakeholders working in food
<br>
systems to advance interdisciplinary collaboration.
<br>
<br>
Leveraging the expertise of food systems
<br>
scholars across UC Davis and the UC System to
<br>
mobilize interdisciplinary teams and compete
<br>
for large-scale funding opportunities requires
<br>
higher levels of collaboration and coordination
<br>
within the university. By providing forums,
<br>
facilitating collaborations and fostering
<br>
connections for interdisciplinary work, the
<br>
World Food Center amplifies the collective
<br>
resources of UC Davis’ centers, institutes and
<br>
faculty. The center serves as a liaison with
<br>
UC Davis units involved with grant-seeking
<br>
and fundraising efforts, such as the Offices
<br>
of Research, Government and Community
<br>
Relations, and Development and Alumni
<br>
Relations. An ongoing dialogue among these
<br>
relevant university units will keep all apprised of opportunities and engaged in tandem to seek
<br>
project and research funding proactively.
<br>
<br>
Recognizing that large-scale food and agricultural research is specialized and evolving, the
<br>
World Food Center will establish its presence among public and private funders to advocate for
<br>
UC Davis’ expertise and facilitate successful procurement of grants for food systems research.
<br>
<br>
The center will foster interdisciplinary cooperation to seek new funding opportunities and
<br>
work in collaboration with services offered by the Office of Research and other development
<br>
resources to achieve these goals.
<br>
<br>
1. The World Food Center will provide ongoing opportunities to convene
<br>
stakeholders from centers and institutes, researchers, and extension specialists
<br>
across all UC Davis schools, colleges and units working in food systems.
<br>
<br>
a.
<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
Map the expertise in food systems across UC Davis, broadening the scope
<br>
as needed to present a complete picture for university and external audiences.
<br>
<br>
This data will contribute to interactive electronic resources currently under
<br>
development in several university units, including the College of Agricultural
<br>
and Environmental Sciences, Global Affairs and the University Library.
<br>
<br>
b. Foster interdisciplinary academic and extension collaboration by providing
<br>
seed funding for workshops, forums, and symposia that bring subject-matter
<br>
experts together via the Aligning the Food System platform.
<br>
<br>
c. Build upon the popular Food for Thought Showcases and other networking
<br>
events as venues for food-focused centers, institutes and faculty at UC Davis
<br>
to present their work to the academic and industry food community.
<br>
<br>
d. Convene interdisciplinary campus stakeholders in value-added networking
<br>
events on a quarterly basis to share developments and opportunities for
<br>
collaboration, particularly among new and junior faculty.

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
e. Support opportunities for students and faculty to interact with the foremost
<br>
agricultural institutions around the world by leading UC Davis’ involvement
<br>
with the A5 Consortium.
<br>
<br>
2. The World Food Center will strengthen UC Davis’ ability to compete for
<br>
large-scale, cross-functional food system projects by serving as an institutional
<br>
resource on funding opportunities and proposal development.
<br>
<br>
a.
<br>
<br>

<br>
Coordinate efforts with UC Davis experts and other campus resources, such
<br>
as the Offices of Research, Government and Community Relations and other
<br>
university and UC system initiatives to identify opportunities and disseminate
<br>
information about large-scale interdisciplinary projects.
<br>
<br>
b. Identify the areas in which large projects are being funded and assemble
<br>
interdisciplinary teams in anticipation of requests for proposals to ensure that
<br>
UC Davis is prepared to act quickly on funding opportunities as they arise.
<br>
<br>
c. Supplement the services offered to potential grantees by the Office of Research
<br>
by creating a staff position to offer specialized expertise and support to faculty
<br>
developing large interdisciplinary grant proposals in food systems.
<br>
<br>
d. Host quarterly conference calls for World Food Center stakeholders with the
<br>
Office of Research and similar units on grant opportunities in food systems,
<br>
including funding trends, upcoming projects and related matters.
<br>
<br>
e. Offer specialized expertise and guidance on the development and coordination
<br>
of international grant proposals in food systems, supported by the College of
<br>
Agricultural and Environmental Sciences Global Engagement office.
<br>
<br>
f. Liaise with university and system-wide programs relevant to food systems,
<br>
including the Big Idea initiatives, One Climate, and One Health to promote
<br>
UC Davis expertise and keep scholars appraised of new initiatives in these fields.
<br>
<br>
g.
<br>
<br>

<br>
Inform and influence public policy by coalescing UC Davis experts in food systems
<br>
to develop science-based policy briefs that align with the efforts of the
<br>
UC Davis Office of Government and Community Relations and the University of
<br>
California Government Relations teams.
<br>
<br>
h. Offer UC Davis’ expertise in food systems to state and national agencies that
<br>
are developing research funding priorities.
