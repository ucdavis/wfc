… Sustainable agriculture and food systems are fundamental to all aspects of human existence,
<br>
requiring significant investment in existing strengths and integrated growth opportunities.”
<br>
The World Food Center will also support other Core Priority Themes by promoting better
<br>
nutrition and health, enabling viable agriculture/landscape/urban ecosystems and meeting the
<br>
challenges of climate change.
<br>
<br>
The World Food Center Strategic Plan translates these broad goals into three major strategic
<br>
priorities and concrete, measurable initiatives to achieve them over the next five years. The
<br>
plan articulates a vision of the World Food Center as a forum to: (1) convene the many centers,
<br>
institutes and faculty working in the areas broadly defined as food systems; (2) connect
<br>
internal and external actors in constructive networking and develop partnerships with industry,
<br>
government and public/private organizations; and (3) communicate the innovations and
<br>
accomplishments of UC Davis centers, institutes, and scholars to amplify their contributions to
<br>
research and extension in global food systems.
