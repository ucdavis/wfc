The Global Challenge and the
<br>
UC Davis Food Landscape
<br>
Challenges to producing sufficient, safe and nutritious
<br>
food are increasing: population growth, climate change,
<br>
resource scarcity and environmental degradation are
<br>
threats to economically viable food systems worldwide.
<br>
<br>
Global population has increased from 3 billion in 1960
<br>
to 7.6 billion today and is anticipated to plateau at nearly
<br>
10 billion by 2050. Increased productivity and efficiency
<br>
gains after 1960 enabled global food production to keep
<br>
pace with population growth with limited expansion of
<br>
the environmental footprint of agriculture until recently.
<br>
<br>
However, these methods were not adopted uniformly
<br>
around the world. Most of the next 2 billion people will
<br>
be born in Africa, where current agricultural yields are
<br>
about 20% of what could be possible. Expanding the area
<br>
of land utilized for food production is not a desirable
<br>
option, as it releases massive amounts of carbon into the
<br>
atmosphere, exacerbating climate change and destructive
<br>
weather events that are threatening current food
<br>
production systems. In addition, as the most productive
<br>
lands are already utilized for food production, expansion
<br>
of agriculture will be on marginally productive lands,
<br>
resulting in diminishing crop yields while accelerating
<br>
deforestation, erosion and greenhouse gas emissions.
<br>
<br>
Thus, applying science and technology to sustainably
<br>
intensify food production on existing agricultural lands is
<br>
the overriding challenge for global agricultural systems.
<br>
<br>
California is an excellent location for research on
<br>
improving efficiency, productivity and sustainability of
<br>
food systems due to the abundance and diversity of its
<br>
agricultural output, its emphasis on the importance of
<br>
human and animal health and nutrition, and its active
<br>
strategies to prevent and mitigate the environmental and
<br>
economic threats to sustaining food production. This
<br>
nexus among food, environment and health inspires
<br>
research and extension work in food systems across
<br>
UC Davis.
<br>
<br>
Global population has
<br>
increased from 3 billion
<br>
in 1960 to 7.6 bilion
<br>
today and is anticipated
<br>
to plateau at nearly
<br>
10 bilion by 2050.
<br>
<br>
California is an excellent
<br>
location for research on
<br>
improving efficiency,
<br>
productivity and
<br>
sustainanility of
<br>
food systems.
