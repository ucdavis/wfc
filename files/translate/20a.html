Metrics for Measuring Success
<br>
To measure the outcomes of this strategic plan, the World Food
<br>
Center will monitor and evaluate the following metrics:
<br>
1. Audience engagement. The World Food Center will measure
<br>
the levels of engagement with audiences at its events via surveys
<br>
and feedback requests. Further metrics will include attendee turn-
<br>
out and participants’ expertise, areas of research, etc., relevant to
<br>
the goals of the specific event. The World Food Center will also
<br>
analyze the representation of experts visiting UC Davis for these
<br>
engagements and evaluate its success in fostering diversity and
<br>
inclusion in its audiences.
<br>
<br>
2. Research and funding outcomes. The number of submitted
<br>
proposals and amount of funding received from the World Food
<br>
Center’s efforts to convene interdisciplinary teams to apply for
<br>
large-scale grant awards and project opportunities will serve as key
<br>
metrics. The size and scope of these projects will document the
<br>
World Food Center’s success in gaining new funding sources for
<br>
UC Davis.
<br>
<br>
3. Outreach and community engagement. As the World Food
<br>
Center engages with the local, regional, and national communities
<br>
and media outlets in food systems, we will tally UC Davis’
<br>
representation on relevant science and policy boards, councils,
<br>
organizations, etc. Outcomes of digital communications will be
<br>
assessed via analysis of data from the World Food Center’s website
<br>
and social media.
<br>
<br>
4. Stakeholder relationships. The World Food Center will catalog
<br>
its relationships with relevant contacts at the major foundations,
<br>
companies, government agencies, and universities in the food and
<br>
agriculture space in a database that will be available to other
<br>
UC Davis units.
