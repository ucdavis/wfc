The Food Landscape at UC Davis
<br>
60+ centers and
<br>
institutes working in
<br>
food systems
<br>
UC Davis is recognized globally for its leadership in agriculture and food systems research,
<br>
extension and outreach. In addition to the College of Agricultural and Environmental
<br>
Sciences, the university has extensive food-related academic resources in the College of
<br>
Biological Sciences, the College of Engineering, the College of Letters and Science, the School
<br>
of Veterinary Medicine, and the School of Medicine. These programs offer undergraduate,
<br>
graduate and professional degree curricula, conduct research, and deliver extension and
<br>
outreach initiatives. UC Davis is home to more than 60 centers, institutes and programs
<br>
outside of the formal academic structure that provide expertise and resources targeted toward
<br>
specific aspects of food systems. Many of these are interdisciplinary and collectively address a
<br>
broad range of topics in food production, delivery, consumption, health and public policy. The
<br>
overriding goal of the World Food Center is to synergize and focus the unparalleled resources
<br>
of UC Davis to address the most important challenges facing the future of human society.
<br>

The World Food Center developed this diagram of the UC Davis food landscape to illustrate
<br>
the breadth of programs serving the needs of regional, national and global food systems. The
<br>
focus is primarily on the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, but food-related
<br>
programs span the entire campus.
