	<page pageNumber="2"><![CDATA[Message from the Director The World Food Center (WFC) was relaunched within the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences in 2018, and I have the pleasure of service as its director from January 2019 until the present. Our mission is to mobilize the research, educational and outreach resources of UC Davis to promote innovative, sustainable and equitable food systems. Ermias Kebreab Director, World Food Center Associate Dean, College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences Professor, Sesnon Endowed Chair in Sustainable Agriculture University of California, Davis In today’s world, the greatest challenges such as food security cannot be solved by one center or institute alone. There are more than 60 organized units at UC Davis spanning several colleges and schools that work on food-related issues. The World Food Center strives to be the connector of these entities and helps develop relationships with industry, government, academic and public/private institutions to promote and apply UC Davis’ expertise in food systems and build mutually beneficial partnerships for research, outreach and education. This year, we are excited to have completed our strategic plan, which will serve as a road map for activities during the next five years. I am particularly pleased to see the level of engagement from diverse centers and institutes across the entire university and beyond in building a consensus-based strategic plan to carry out our central goals of convening, connecting and communicating regarding issues related to food systems. I encourage you to read the strategic plan, which is available on our newly revamped website at worldfoodcenter.ucdavis.edu. You can also follow us on twitter (@ucdavisWFC) as we announce numerous events throughout the year. In this annual report, you will learn about our various accomplishments from the past year as we look forward to more engagement with faculty, staff, students and our partners both in California and across the globe. I hope you will join us in our mission! ]]></page>

The document details the WFC’s plan to tap into the depth of food and agriculture scholarship and extension, develop partnerships in research and innovation, and raise the visibility of UC Davis’ expertise and resources in food systems. Following an initial Aligning the Food System workshop in 2018, the WFC sponsored four additional events within this series in 2019 on multidisciplinary and interconnected food systems topics in association with campus centers and extramural partners including: • Aligning the Food System for Improved Nutrition: A Focus on Animal Source Foods (May) • Food Safety Considerations for Developing Food Waste Solutions (May) Supporting Transdisciplinary Collaboration Strengthening Food System Networks The WFC co-sponsored several events aimed at building a network of scientists from different disciplines to tackle global food security issues. These events included the World Agri-Tech Innovation Summit, a two-day globally attended event in San Francisco. Three events aimed at building and strengthening networks were hosted by the WFC on the UC Davis campus in partnership with industry and international food system leaders: the AgTech Showcase in January, the Food Security Innovation Workshop in October, and the Dialogues and Discourse in Science and Society in November. All provided opportunities for networking, collaboration and innovation. Showcasing UC Davis World Food Connections The World Food Center fostered our global connections to food systems by hosting a World Food Day celebration on the UC Davis campus and presenting an exhibit booth at the World Food Prize in Iowa. • Summer School: UC Network on Child Health, Poverty, and Public Policy (September) • Developing an Agrifoods System Blueprint for California (September) ANNUAL REPORT 2019 1	 ]]></page>

Provide an educational experience that prepares all of our students to address the needs and challenges of a diverse and changing world. 2. Enable and support research that matters at the frontiers of knowledge, across and between the disciplines, in support of a healthy planet and the physical and societal well-being of its inhabitants. 3. Embrace diversity, practice inclusive excellence and strive for equity. Make UC Davis a place of excellence for learning and working by supporting a culture that values the contributions and aspirations of all of our students, staff and faculty; promotes wellness and a culture of sustainability; and cultivates the open interchange of ideas. 4. Support our community, region, state, nation and world through mutually beneficial and impactful partnerships that reflect a firm commitment to our mission and increase the visibility and reputation of the university. 5. Create an intellectual and physical environment that supports the development of an innovative and entrepreneurial culture that extends the benefits of our research activities beyond the boundaries of the university. 2 UC DAVIS WORLD FOOD CENTER Convene, Connect, Communicate A strategic plan for the WFC The World Food Center’s move to the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences in 2017 and subsequent revitalization provided an opportunity for its emergence as a leader in both the college and campus global efforts. A series of informational campus events were designed to foster university-wide interdisciplinary engagement. These events and following conversations and consultation with more than 100 leading UC Davis faculty, staff, center directors, and department heads resulted in a strategic plan for enhancing the value and impact of the WFC. The strategic plan for the WFC incorporates the vision developed by the UC Davis ‘To Boldly Go’ Goals, the Global Affairs Strategic Plan, and the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences strategic plan “Meeting the Challenges of 21st Century Global Change.” These goals and inputs from campus leaders and a soon anticipated University-wide Global Strategic Plan (2021) guided the development of the World Food Center Strategic Plan for 2019-2024. The plan focuses on three main priorities for the WFC: to Convene, Connect and Communicate. ]]></page>
	<page pageNumber="5"><![CDATA[Strategic Priority 1 The World Food Center will CONVENE internal UC Davis stakeholders working in food systems to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and support their success. With this priority, the World Food Center will raise awareness of the collective depth and breadth of food systems resources at UC Davis and bring centers, institutes and faculty together to identify and address grand challenges in food systems. It will build upon existing programs and develop new ones to become a university-wide epicenter for food systems experts by providing forums to share information, promote research, encourage collaborations and foster connections for interdisciplinary work. Strategic Priority II The World Food Center will CONNECT UC Davis expertise in global food systems to external partners to support research opportunities and foster entrepreneurial partnerships. Tapping the collective expertise available at UC Davis requires the mobilization of collaborative partnerships between campus units and external organizations, including government agencies, industry, foundations, funders and national and international research institutions. The World Food Center will work to raise UC Davis’ visibility as the premier university for food systems research and practice and a world leader in food systems expertise. It will proactively cultivate relationships with external organizations in the public/private sector who have the potential to partner with UC Davis experts on research and problem-solving in food systems and develop pathways to connect them to campus experts and research groups. Strategic Priority III The World Food Center will COMMUNICATE the UC Davis food story both internally and externally. The World Food Center has a combination of internal and external audiences. At UC Davis, food and agriculture-focused centers, institutes and faculty benefit from the World Food Center’s communications, while the food and agriculture industries, donors, investors and policy makers are also valuable audiences for communications content from the World Food Center. The World Food Center will develop a communications infrastructure and strategy to share the UC Davis story to internal and external stakeholders and to achieve the ambitious agenda laid out in this strategic plan. Communications is the vehicle through which the World Food Center can convene the actors and connect with partners and stakeholders within UC Davis, across the UC system, and in regional, national and international arenas.
