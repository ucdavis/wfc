<br>
Thank you and welcome!
<br>
The WFC recognizes the contributions of Kaylee D’Amico, who served as
<br>
Program Manager from February 2018 through November 2019. She did an
<br>
outstanding job, and we wish her well in her new position with the California
<br>
State government. We also welcome Andrea Thompson, who began as
<br>
Associate Program Director in March 2020 and is the primary point of contact
<br>
with the WFC (aehthompson@ucdavis.edu).

Special Thanks
