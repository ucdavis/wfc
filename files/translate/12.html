Strategic Priorities
<br>
Strategic Priority I:
<br>
The World Food Center will CONVENE UC Davis stakeholders working in food
<br>
systems to advance interdisciplinary collaboration.
<br>
<br>
Leveraging the expertise of food systems
<br>
scholars across UC Davis and the UC System to
<br>
mobilize interdisciplinary teams and compete
<br>
for large-scale funding opportunities requires
<br>
higher levels of collaboration and coordination
<br>
within the university. By providing forums,
<br>
facilitating collaborations and fostering
<br>
connections for interdisciplinary work, the
<br>
World Food Center amplifies the collective
<br>
resources of UC Davis’ centers, institutes and
<br>
faculty. The center serves as a liaison with
<br>
UC Davis units involved with grant-seeking
<br>
and fundraising efforts, such as the Offices
<br>
of Research, Government and Community
<br>
Relations, and Development and Alumni
<br>
Relations. An ongoing dialogue among these
<br>
relevant university units will keep all apprised of opportunities and engaged in tandem to seek
<br>
project and research funding proactively.
<br>
<br>
Recognizing that large-scale food and agricultural research is specialized and evolving, the
<br>
World Food Center will establish its presence among public and private funders to advocate for
<br>
UC Davis’ expertise and facilitate successful procurement of grants for food systems research.
<br>
<br>
The center will foster interdisciplinary cooperation to seek new funding opportunities and
<br>
work in collaboration with services offered by the Office of Research and other development
<br>
resources to achieve these goals.
<br>
<br>
1. The World Food Center will provide ongoing opportunities to convene
<br>
stakeholders from centers and institutes, researchers, and extension specialists
<br>
across all UC Davis schools, colleges and units working in food systems.
<br>
<br>
a.
<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>
Map the expertise in food systems across UC Davis, broadening the scope
<br>
as needed to present a complete picture for university and external audiences.
<br>
<br>
This data will contribute to interactive electronic resources currently under
<br>
development in several university units, including the College of Agricultural
<br>
and Environmental Sciences, Global Affairs and the University Library.
<br>
<br>
b. Foster interdisciplinary academic and extension collaboration by providing
<br>
seed funding for workshops, forums, and symposia that bring subject-matter
<br>
experts together via the Aligning the Food System platform.
<br>
<br>
c. Build upon the popular Food for Thought Showcases and other networking
<br>
events as venues for food-focused centers, institutes and faculty at UC Davis
<br>
to present their work to the academic and industry food community.
<br>
<br>
d. Convene interdisciplinary campus stakeholders in value-added networking
<br>
events on a quarterly basis to share developments and opportunities for
<br>
collaboration, particularly among new and junior faculty.
