Background
<br>
Ranked 1st nationally
<br>
in agriculture
<br>
UC Davis is ranked first in the nation in agriculture and
<br>
veterinary science. The breadth, depth and quality of the
<br>
university’s faculty, research and educational programs in
<br>
food systems and its many related areas is long-standing
<br>
and indisputable. UC Davis’ strategic plan, To Boldly
<br>
Go, acknowledges this strength as a significant asset on
<br>
which the university must build to advance its important
<br>
agenda “to enable and support research… that matters
<br>
across and between the disciplines, in support of a
<br>
healthy planet and the physical and societal well-being of
<br>
its inhabitants.”
<br>
The UC Davis World Food Center was established in
<br>
2013 by the Office of the Chancellor and is now housed
<br>
within the College of Agricultural and Environmental
<br>
Sciences, working with constituencies across the
<br>
university and beyond. The center is part of the College’s
<br>
Global Engagement pillar and operates under the
<br>
leadership of an Associate Dean.
<br>
<br>
1st in the world for
<br>
veterinary medicine
<br>
The World Food Center mobilizes the resources of UC
<br>
Davis to promote innovative, sustainable and equitable
<br>
food systems and serves as a portal to the talent and
<br>
expertise within the university. The World Food Center
<br>
works in tandem with researchers from UC Davis and
<br>
other academic institutions, public sector officials, civic
<br>
organizations and private industry partners to develop
<br>
innovative solutions for challenges facing local and global
<br>
food systems.
<br>
<br>
To Boldly Go expressly endorses the World Food Center
<br>
as an important vehicle to coordinate UC Davis’ strength in global food systems and “mobilize
<br>
the research, educational and outreach resources in partnership with consumers, public and
<br>
philanthropic entities, and agricultural, marine and food industries, to promote innovative,
<br>
sustainable and equitable food systems.” To Boldly Go also envisions that the coordination of
<br>
interdisciplinary clusters of research excellence through the World Food Center will increase
<br>
the visibility of UC Davis’ broad expertise in food systems and related topics, while providing
<br>
access to larger-scale funding opportunities requiring interdisciplinary solutions.
<br>
<br>
The World Food Center strategic plan also builds on the Core Priority Themes described
<br>
in the current College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences’ Strategic Plan (2015-
<br>
2020), contributing in particular to the Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems theme. As
<br>
noted there, “sustainable agriculture and food systems ensure secure, safe, and high quality
<br>
healthful food for the world’s population without negative social and environmental impacts.
