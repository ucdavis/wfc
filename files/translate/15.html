Strategic Priority II:
<br>
The World Food Center will CONNECT UC Davis experts in global food systems
<br>
to external partners to facilitate research opportunities and foster partnerships.
<br>
<br>
To Boldly Go envisions a future where dialogue across the disciplines provides the foundation
<br>
for interdisciplinary solutions to grand challenges facing global food systems. Ensuring that
<br>
the collective expertise available at UC Davis is frequently and effectively utilized requires the
<br>
mobilization of collaborative partnerships between university units and external organizations,
<br>
including government agencies, industry, foundations, funders, and national and international
<br>
research institutions.
<br>
<br>
The World Food Center will work to elevate UC Davis’ recognition as a world leader for
<br>
food systems research and practice. The center will cultivate relationships with external
<br>
organizations in the public/private sectors that have the potential to partner with UC Davis on
<br>
research and problem-solving initiatives in food systems and connect them to campus experts
<br>
and research units.
<br>
<br>
1. The World Food Center will systematically and proactively cultivate
<br>
relationships with funders and collaborators to propel UC Davis’ position
<br>

<br>
global leader in food systems.
<br>
<br>
a. Build relationships with foundations and companies in the food and
<br>
agriculture industries with funding and research priorities that overlap with
<br>
campus expertise. Proactively influence grant-making priorities using policy
<br>
briefs and research reports to position UC Davis as a leading contender for
<br>
funding and project leadership opportunities.
<br>
<br>
b. Establish ongoing relationships with scientific councils, policy groups, think
<br>
tanks, and similar organizations to promote emerging research and innovation
<br>
in the food and agriculture space.
<br>
<br>
c. Promote UC Davis at major conferences and events around the world to
<br>
raise the profile of the university, make connections with potential partners
<br>
and collaborators, and stay abreast of current initiatives and emerging research
<br>
in the field.
<br>
<br>
d. Serve as a portal to connect external stakeholders with expertise at UC Davis.
<br>
<br>
