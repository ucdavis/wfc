2 UC DAVIS WORLD FOOD CENTER
<br>
Convene, Connect,
<br>
Communicate A strategic plan for the WFC
<br>
The World Food Center’s move to the College of Agricultural and
<br>
Environmental Sciences in 2017 and subsequent revitalization provided an
<br>
opportunity for its emergence as a leader in both the college and campus
<br>
global efforts. A series of informational campus events were designed to
<br>
foster university-wide interdisciplinary engagement. These events and
<br>
following conversations and consultation with more than 100 leading
<br>
UC Davis faculty, staff, center directors, and department heads resulted
<br>
in a strategic plan for enhancing the value and impact of the WFC.
<br>
<br>
The strategic plan for the WFC incorporates the vision developed by
<br>
the UC Davis ‘To Boldly Go’ Goals, the Global Affairs Strategic Plan, and
<br>
the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences strategic plan
<br>
“Meeting the Challenges of 21st Century Global Change.” These goals and
<br>
inputs from campus leaders and a soon anticipated University-wide Global
<br>
Strategic Plan (2021) guided the development of the World Food Center
<br>
Strategic Plan for 2019-2024. The plan focuses on three main priorities for
<br>
the WFC: to Convene, Connect and Communicate.
<br>
<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>

<br>
Strategic Priority 1
<br>
The World Food Center will CONVENE internal UC Davis stakeholders working in food systems
<br>
to encourage interdisciplinary collaboration and support their success.
<br>
<br>
With this priority, the World Food Center will raise awareness of the collective depth and breadth
<br>
of food systems resources at UC Davis and bring centers, institutes and faculty together to identify
<br>
and address grand challenges in food systems. It will build upon existing programs and develop
<br>
new ones to become a university-wide epicenter for food systems experts by providing forums to
<br>
share information, promote research, encourage collaborations and foster connections for
<br>
interdisciplinary work.
<br>
<br>
Strategic Priority II
<br>
The World Food Center will CONNECT UC Davis expertise in global food systems to external
<br>
partners to support research opportunities and foster entrepreneurial partnerships.
<br>
<br>
Tapping the collective expertise available at UC Davis requires the mobilization of collaborative
<br>
partnerships between campus units and external organizations, including government agencies,
<br>
industry, foundations, funders and national and international research institutions.
<br>
<br>
The World Food Center will work to raise UC Davis’ visibility as the premier university for food
<br>
systems research and practice and a world leader in food systems expertise. It will proactively cultivate
<br>
relationships with external organizations in the public/private sector who have the potential to partner
<br>
with UC Davis experts on research and problem-solving in food systems and develop pathways to
<br>
connect them to campus experts and research groups.
<br>
<br>
Strategic Priority III
<br>
The World Food Center will COMMUNICATE the UC Davis food story both internally
<br>
and externally.
<br>
<br>
The World Food Center has a combination of internal and external audiences. At UC Davis,
<br>
food and agriculture-focused centers, institutes and faculty benefit from the World Food Center’s
<br>
communications, while the food and agriculture industries, donors, investors and policy makers are
<br>
also valuable audiences for communications content from the World Food Center.
<br>
<br>
The World Food Center will develop a communications infrastructure and strategy to share the
<br>
UC Davis story to internal and external stakeholders and to achieve the ambitious agenda laid out in
<br>
this strategic plan. Communications is the vehicle through which the World Food Center can convene
<br>
the actors and connect with partners and stakeholders within UC Davis, across the UC system, and in
<br>
regional, national and international arenas.
