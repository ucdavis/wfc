The breadth, depth and quality of the university’s faculty, research and educational programs in food systems and its many related areas is long-standing and indisputable. UC Davis’ strategic plan, To Boldly Go, acknowledges this strength as a significant asset on which the university must build to advance its important agenda “to enable and support research… that matters across and between the disciplines, in support of a healthy planet and the physical and societal well-being of its inhabitants.” The UC Davis World Food Center was established in 2013 by the Office of the Chancellor and is now housed within the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, working with constituencies across the university and beyond. The center is part of the College’s Global Engagement pillar and operates under the leadership of an Associate Dean. 1st in the world for veterinary medicine The World Food Center mobilizes the resources of UC Davis to promote innovative, sustainable and equitable food systems and serves as a portal to the talent and expertise within the university. The World Food Center works in tandem with researchers from UC Davis and other academic institutions, public sector officials, civic organizations and private industry partners to develop innovative solutions for challenges facing local and global food systems. To Boldly Go expressly endorses the World Food Center as an important vehicle to coordinate UC Davis’ strength in global food systems and “mobilize the research, educational and outreach resources in partnership with consumers, public and philanthropic entities, and agricultural, marine and food industries, to promote innovative, sustainable and equitable food systems.” To Boldly Go also envisions that the coordination of interdisciplinary clusters of research excellence through the World Food Center will increase the visibility of UC Davis’ broad expertise in food systems and related topics, while providing access to larger-scale funding opportunities requiring interdisciplinary solutions. The World Food Center strategic plan also builds on the Core Priority Themes described in the current College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences’ Strategic Plan (2015- 2020), contributing in particular to the Sustainable Agriculture and Food Systems theme. As noted there, “sustainable agriculture and food systems ensure secure, safe, and high quality healthful food for the world’s population without negative social and environmental impacts. 2 UC DAVIS WORLD FOOD CENTER \t ",

                "data": "The Global Challenge and the UC Davis Food Landscape Challenges to producing sufficient, safe and nutritious food are increasing: population growth, climate change, resource scarcity and environmental degradation are threats to economically viable food systems worldwide. Global population has increased from 3 billion in 1960 to 7.6 billion today and is anticipated to plateau at nearly 10 billion by 2050. Increased productivity and efficiency gains after 1960 enabled global food production to keep pace with population growth with limited expansion of the environmental footprint of agriculture until recently. However, these methods were not adopted uniformly around the world. Most of the next 2 billion people will be born in Africa, where current agricultural yields are about 20% of what could be possible. Expanding the area of land utilized for food production is not a desirable option, as it releases massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change and destructive weather events that are threatening current food production systems. In addition, as the most productive lands are already utilized for food production, expansion of agriculture will be on marginally productive lands, resulting in diminishing crop yields while accelerating deforestation, erosion and greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, applying science and technology to sustainably intensify food production on existing agricultural lands is the overriding challenge for global agricultural systems. California is an excellent location for research on improving efficiency, productivity and sustainability of food systems due to the abundance and diversity of its agricultural output, its emphasis on the importance of human and animal health and nutrition, and its active strategies to prevent and mitigate the environmental and economic threats to sustaining food production. This nexus among food, environment and health inspires research and extension work in food systems across UC Davis. Global population has increased from 3 billion in 1960 to 7.6 bilion today and is anticipated to plateau at nearly 10 bilion by 2050.

Upon the World Food Center’s transition to the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, a new framework for activities was developed by a faculty visioning committee and launched in 2017 under the leadership of an interim director. This strategy was implemented by refocusing the mission of the World Food Center and establishing a series of successful pilot programs to foster university-wide interdisciplinary engagement. Development of this strategic plan started in February 2018 by interviewing UC Davis faculty members and regional industry and community leaders to discuss how the World Food Center could support their goals. In January 2019, the College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences appointed an Associate Dean of Global Engagement to direct the World Food Center and the College’s international programs. The Associate Dean, in collaboration with the Steering Committee for the 2019 strategic planning process, has worked diligently to translate these recommendations into an ambitious program with three main goals to be accomplished with concrete, measurable steps. 20 UC DAVIS WORLD FOOD CENTER \t ",
